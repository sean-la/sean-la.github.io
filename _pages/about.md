Hello! I’m Sean, a data scientist based in Vancouver, BC. With four years of experience in applying data science and machine learning to the gaming and B2B SaaS industries, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive growth and innovation.

Over the years, I’ve worked with dynamic teams to build predictive models, optimize business processes, and enhance user experiences. My expertise spans across machine learning, statistical modeling, data visualization, and advanced analytics—skills I leverage to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

I offer consulting services for companies looking to harness the power of their data. Whether you’re looking to optimize existing processes, develop custom machine learning solutions, or make sense of your data, I’m here to help you unlock your full potential.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my services!
